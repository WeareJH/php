# wearejh/php

Docker recipes for PHP images we can use at JH. Based on the [official PHP images](https://store.docker.com/images/php), souped up with extra gubbins.

[wearejh/php on Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wearejh/php/tags/)

## Building an image

```sh
./build.sh php-version [tag]
```

n.b. The build script is likely just a placeholder until someone smarter than Anny comes along and automates this with Travis or, like... what have you.
